# Terminology

The language we use has power. Being as concise and descriptive as possible helps to lessen ambiguity. This leads to shared understanding and better outcomes.

## Terms

* Use `blocklist`, and not `blacklist`.
* Use `allowlist`, and not `whitelist`.
* Avoid using `master` and `slave`. 
	* For GitHub, use a term such as `main`, or `publish`, `production`, or `trunk`.
	* For databases, use `write database` and `read replica`.
	* For other scenarios, use terms such as `parent` and `child` or `leader` and `follower`.
* Use terms such as `excused` or `exempted` in place of `grandfathered`.
* Use `negative space`, and not `white space`.
* Use `billable hours`, and not `man hours`.
